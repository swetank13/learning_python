    "1. If the identifier starts with _ symbol then it indicates that it is private.\n",
    "2. If identifier starts with __(Two Under Score Symbols) indicating that strongly private identifier.\n",
    "3. If the identifier starts and ends with two underscore symbols, then the identifier is a language defined special name, which is also known as magic methods.\n",
    "4. All Fundamental Data types are immutable.\n",
    "5. In Python if a new object is required, then PVM(Python Virtual Machine) won’t create object immediately. First it will check is any object available with the required content or not. If available then existing object will be reused. If it is not available then only a new object will be created. The advantage of this approach is memory utilization and performance will be improved.\n",
    "But the problem in this approach is, several references pointing to the same object, by using one reference if we are allowed to change the content in the existing object then the remaining references will be affected. To prevent this immutability concept is required. According to this, once we create an object we are not allowed to change content. If we are changing with those changes a new object will be created.\n",
    "6. Bytes data type: The only allowed values for byte data type are 0 to 256. By mistake, if we are trying to provide any other values then we will get a value error.\n"
